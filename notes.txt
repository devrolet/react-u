React components are only run once. If you want the UI to be updated, you must tell React to update it

Update React components and app with STATE. useState, getState, setState

React Hooks - Tells React what to do at different times of the component lifecycle
-- All of them start with use. i.e. useState

IMPORTANT!!!

// TODO: ALERT: ONLY CALL HOOKS INSIDE OF COMPONENT FUNCTIONS
GOOD
function App() {
    const [val, setVal] = useState(0);
}

BAD
const [val, setVal] = useState(0);

function App() {...}

// TODO: ALERT: ONLY CALL HOOKS ON THE TOP LEVEL
GOOD
function App() {
    const [val, setVal] = useState(0);
}

BAD
function App() {
    if(someCondition) {
        const [val, setVal] = useState(0);
    }
}

useState() ALWAYS YIELDS AN ARRAY WITH TWO ELEMENTS, EXACTLY TWO ELEMENTS
